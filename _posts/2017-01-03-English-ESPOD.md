  A Day in the life of Lucy

### Episode 1  Geting up 


On a weekday, I usually get up around 6:30 a.m., but I set my alarm to go off at
6:20 so that I can hit the snooze button to sleep another 10 minutes. My
roommate thinks I’m crazy, but doing this in the mornings actually helps me wake
up. I’m a night owl, not an early bird like she is, so I need an extra few minutes
to get going in the morning.
One reason it’s so hard to get up is because my bedroom and my bed are so
comfortable. I splurged and bought a bed with a very soft, thick mattress. I also
have matching sheets and pillowcases, and a comforter that is made of goose
down. Even my nightstand matches my sheets and the rest of my bedroom. I
decorated it so that it would be restful after a busy day at work.
When I get up, the first thing I do is put on my robe. It’s always so cold in the
apartment in the mornings, no matter what time of year it is. Then, I usually
make my bed. I hated making my bed when I was little, but now it’s become a
routine. Sometimes, though, I’m so tired that I sleep in for just a little too long
and then, the bed definitely doesn’t get made. On those days, I wish I could
sleep in all day!
